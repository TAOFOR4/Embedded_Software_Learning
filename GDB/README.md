## Introduction to GDB

GDB is a versatile debugging tool that allows developers to:

- Inspect the state of a program while it is running.
- Execute programs step-by-step to observe behavior.
- Modify variables and program flow during execution.
- Diagnose crashes and unexpected behavior.

GDB supports various programming languages and is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems, but it is also available on Windows.

## Installation

### On Linux

Most Linux distributions include GDB in their package repositories.

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdb

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install gdb

# For Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S gdb
```

### On macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install GDB.

```bash
brew install gdb
```

**Note:** GDB on macOS requires additional configuration due to macOS's security features. Refer to [Homebrew's GDB documentation](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gdb) for detailed instructions.

## Starting GDB

To debug a program with GDB, you need to compile it with debugging information.

### Compiling with Debugging Symbols

Use the `-g` flag with `gcc` or `g++` to include debug information.

```bash
gcc -g -o myprogram myprogram.c
```

### Launching GDB

Start GDB by specifying the executable:

```bash
gdb ./myprogram
```

Alternatively, you can start GDB and then load the program:

```bash
gdb
(gdb) file ./myprogram
```

---

## Setting Breakpoints

Breakpoints allow you to pause program execution at specific points.

### Setting a Breakpoint at a Function

```gdb
(gdb) break main
```

### Setting a Breakpoint at a Line Number

```gdb
(gdb) break 25
```

### Setting a Breakpoint in a Specific File

```gdb
(gdb) break myfile.c:30
```

### Viewing Breakpoints

```gdb
(gdb) info breakpoints
```

### Removing Breakpoints

```gdb
(gdb) delete 1
```
*Removes breakpoint number 1.*

---

## Running the Program

After setting breakpoints, start the program:

```gdb
(gdb) run
```

If the program requires command-line arguments, provide them after `run`:

```gdb
(gdb) run arg1 arg2
```

---

## Inspecting Variables

### Printing Variable Values

```gdb
(gdb) print variable_name
```

Example:

```gdb
(gdb) print x
$1 = 5
```

### Examining Pointers and Structures

```gdb
(gdb) print *ptr
(gdb) print my_struct.field
```

### Displaying All Local Variables

```gdb
(gdb) info locals
```

### Displaying All Global Variables

```gdb
(gdb) info variables
```

---

## Step Execution

### Stepping Into Functions

```gdb
(gdb) step
```

This command executes the next line of code, stepping into any function calls.

### Stepping Over Functions

```gdb
(gdb) next
```

Executes the next line of code, but steps over function calls without entering them.

### Stepping Out of Functions

```gdb
(gdb) finish
```

Continues execution until the current function returns.

---

## Continuing Execution

After hitting a breakpoint or stopping, you can continue running the program.

```gdb
(gdb) continue
```

---

## Listing Source Code

### Listing Current Location

```gdb
(gdb) list
```

Displays the current line and surrounding code.

### Listing a Specific Function or Line Range

```gdb
(gdb) list main
(gdb) list 10,20
```

---

## Watchpoints

Watchpoints allow you to monitor the value of a variable and stop execution when it changes.

### Setting a Watchpoint

```gdb
(gdb) watch variable_name
```

### Viewing Watchpoints

```gdb
(gdb) info watchpoints
```

### Deleting Watchpoints

```gdb
(gdb) delete watch 1
```

*Removes watchpoint number 1.*

---

## Debugging Multi-threaded Programs

GDB provides commands to manage and inspect multiple threads.

### Listing Threads

```gdb
(gdb) info threads
```

### Switching to a Different Thread

```gdb
(gdb) thread 2
```

### Setting Breakpoints on Specific Threads

```gdb
(gdb) break myfunction if thread==2
```

### Continuing All Threads

```gdb
(gdb) continue
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Breakpoints

Set breakpoints that only trigger when a condition is met.

```gdb
(gdb) break myfile.c:50 if x > 10
```

### TUI Mode (Text User Interface)

GDB’s TUI mode provides a split view with source code and GDB commands.

```gdb
(gdb) layout src
```

Toggle TUI mode:

```gdb
(gdb) tui enable
(gdb) tui disable
```

### Scripting with GDB

Automate GDB tasks using scripts.

```gdb
# Example script.gdb
break main
run
print x
continue
```

Run GDB with the script:

```bash
gdb -x script.gdb ./myprogram
```

### Reverse Debugging

Allows you to step backwards through program execution (if supported).

```gdb
(gdb) target record
(gdb) reverse-step
```

**Note:** Reverse debugging support depends on the system and how the program was compiled.

### Core Dumps

Analyze program crashes using core dumps.

1. **Enable Core Dumps**:

   ```bash
   ulimit -c unlimited
   ```

2. **Run the Program to Generate a Core Dump**.

3. **Load Core Dump in GDB**:

   ```bash
   gdb ./myprogram core
   ```

4. **Inspect the State at Crash**:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) bt
   ```

---

## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through a simple example to demonstrate GDB usage.

### Sample Program: `example.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int result = add(x, y);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Compile with Debugging Symbols**:

   ```bash


   gcc -g -o example example.c
   ```

2. **Start GDB**:

   ```bash
   gdb ./example
   ```

3. **Set a Breakpoint at `main`**:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) break main
   Breakpoint 1 at 0x4005ed: file example.c, line 8.
   ```

4. **Run the Program**:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) run
   Starting program: /path/to/example
   Breakpoint 1, main () at example.c:8
   8           int x = 5;
   ```

5. **Inspect Variables**:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) info locals
   x = 5
   y = 10
   result = 0
   ```

6. **Step to Next Line**:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) next
   9           int y = 10;
   ```

7. **Continue to the `add` Function Call**:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) next
   10          int result = add(x, y);
   ```

8. **Step Into the `add` Function**:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) step
   add (a=5, b=10) at example.c:4
   4       return a + b;
   ```

9. **Print the Return Value**:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) print a
    $1 = 5
    (gdb) print b
    $2 = 10
    ```

10. **Finish the `add` Function**:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) finish
    Run till exit from #0  add (a=5, b=10) at example.c:4
    0x00000000004005f2 in add (a=5, b=10) at example.c:4
    Return value: 15
    ```

11. **Inspect `result` Variable**:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) print result
    $3 = 15
    ```

12. **Continue Execution to End**:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) continue
    Continuing.
    Result: 15
    [Inferior 1 (process 12345) exited normally]
    ```

13. **Exit GDB**:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) quit
    ```
